# GIAIC Assignment No. 4 - Python & Streamlit Projects

Welcome to my **GIAIC Assignment No. 4**! In this assignment, I developed a collection of **70+ projects** ranging from mini Python programs to web apps using **Streamlit**. These projects helped me build a solid foundation in Python programming, while also providing hands-on experience with various libraries and concepts.

## 📚 **Projects Overview**

### 🔹 **Streamlit Projects**
1. **BMI Calculator** 💪  
   A simple and interactive BMI calculator that helps users check their Body Mass Index by inputting their weight and height.  

2. **Weather App** 🌦️  
   A dynamic weather application to check the current weather based on the user's location or a city of choice.  

3. **Country Search** 🌍  
   A country information app that provides details about any country (like population, capital, etc.) using an API.  

4. **Country Cards** 🃏  
   Displays a beautiful UI with country cards showing important details about countries worldwide.  

### 🔹 **Mini Projects**
1. **Number Guessing Game** 🎮  
   A fun game where the computer selects a random number, and the player has to guess it.

2. **MadLibs Game** 📝  
   A word-based game that lets the user fill in blanks to generate a funny or creative story.

3. **Hangman** 🤐  
   A classic word-guessing game where players try to guess the letters of a hidden word before running out of attempts.

4. **Rock, Paper, Scissors** ✂️  
   A simple version of the popular game, where the player competes against the computer.

5. **Countdown Timer** ⏳  
   A countdown timer app where users can set a time and see the countdown in real-time.

### 🔹 **Python Basics Projects**
These projects helped me improve my basic Python skills, such as:
- **Functions** 🧑‍💻
- **Conditionals** ❓
- **Loops** 🔁
- **Logic building** 🔍

These mini-projects are simple but effective in learning how to apply logic, handle user input, and develop basic algorithms.
